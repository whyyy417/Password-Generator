<h1>Password Generator</h1>
<p>For Scrimba's second solo project in the javascript Course, I am tasked with creating a password generator. I included the ability to create two random passwords with just a click of a button. I also included a copy button for each password. Through the process of creating the generator, I worked with, for loops and navigator.clipboard to reach the final product.</p>
